My first co-op was with SmarterTravel, working as a Software Engineer.

I fixed bugs and assisted in the development of new features on sites such as [BookingBuddy](http://www.bookingbuddy.com/), [OneTime](http://www.onetime.com/), [AirfareWatchdog](http://www.airfarewatchdog.com), and [SmarterTravel](http://www.smartertravel.com/).
